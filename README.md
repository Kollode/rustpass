# About

Little hobby project to get something done in Rust. At the moment it will only display the header of a KDBX file.
In the future it should decrypt the file and make the database searchable.

# Useful links

* KDBX and KDB explained: https://gist.github.com/lgg/e6ccc6e212d18dd2ecd8a8c116fb1e45

# Thinks I need to take a look at

* crypto: How the fuck does it work -.-
* Little and Big-Endian and what it means for the key generation
* I should write some tests and benchmarks, just so see how that works
